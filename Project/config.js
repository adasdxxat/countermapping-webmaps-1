    title: 'Revealing the invisible challenges of pedestrians with disability',
    para1: "Since December 2021, throughout the Seoul metropolitan area, Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination (SADD) has been holding protests at subway stations to increase awareness of the mobility rights of people with disabilities. The Seoul metropolitan area, covering 12.6 percent of the Republic of Korea's land area, is home to 50.25 percent of the countryâ€™s population. People with disabilities are increasingly seen as particularly vulnerable pedestrians in this area, according to statistics. Being among the most vulnerable pedestrians, this study focused on the rights to mobility for those with disabilities. It investigated at the circumstances under which they might lead a stable and safe life in the urban area. Twenty people with disabilities participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews for qualitative research in order to conduct a current situation assessment and learn directly about the challenges of the most vulnerable pedestrians in the Seoul metropolitan area.",

            description: 'Seoul is the capital city of South Korea with high population density. The number of people with disabilities in this area was point forty-five million (453,031) in 2001, but it has more than doubled to one milion1,082,077 in 2018. In 2004, the movement in the Seoul metropolitan area to abolish discrimination against people with disabilities related to the occupation of subways and buses was successful in installing elevators in 90% of the subways in the city. Yet, people with disabilities still do not have safe and stable access to bus, taxi, and subway platforms. Many disabled people groups have consistently raised their voices on this issue, but in reality, little has changed, and protests started again in December 2021. Throughout the Seoul metropolitan area, Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination,SADD, has been holding protests at subway stations to increase awareness of the mobility rights of people with disabilities. Among the 25 districts in Seoul, Gangbuk-gu has the highest proportion of persons with disabilities over 2.5% of the total population.',
