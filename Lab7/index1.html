  	<h2>Public and Affordable Housing Flood Risk</h2>
    From late October to early November of 2012, New York was hit by Superstorm Sandy. This influence has had a wide-ranging impact on the lives of many citizens. This post sought to examine how Sandy affected public and affordable housing in New York City. First, blue part was based on Sandy Inundation Zone data released in 2015 by the NYC Department of Small Business Services (SBS). This information comes from areas of New York City that were flooded by Hurricane Sandy.Second, the orange part is public housing projetcs in NYC. The second source is the New York City Housing Authority as of June 2022. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) first distributed it in 2013.
    This will not only allow us to assess the impact of Sandy, but it will also allow us to plan ahead by determining which public and affordable housing developments, such as those in lower Manhattan and the Red Hook, will be adversely affected by flooding.
